A simple script to generate and verify free mega.nz accounts in seconds.

Instructions:   
**Before running the commands below, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com)**.
```
git clone https://github.com/crackhub-dev/mega-account-generator.git
cd mega-account-generator
npm i
node .
```

Account details are stored in `details.json`
- `password` = your mega.nz password
- `emailPassword` = your email password (you can sign in on https://mail.tm with this if you need to access the email.)


if the script crashes, make sure to clear the `./tmp` directory before re-running it.
